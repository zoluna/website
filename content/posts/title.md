Here you can find some projects that I have been involved in, creatively or otherwise.

## Social media

I am the chief online editor of [Kölncampus](https://www.instagram.com/koelncampus/?hl=de), one of Germany's largest college campus radio stations. With my team of editors I manage the Kölncampus Instagram, Twitter and Facebook accounts. My work includes community management, content creation and journalism as well as the coordination of my teams editorial efforts.

## Coding

You can find my programming endeavours on my [github profile](https://github.com/zoluna). 

## Modeling

As a professional model signed to one of the biggest european agencies for male modeling, I have worked for a variety of fashion brands and walked Fashion Weeks in London and Paris. Clients include [Balenciaga](https://www.tomorrowisanotherday.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Balenciaga_AW18_Alex_B-667x1000.jpg), [Rick Owens](https://www.tomorrowisanotherday.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Rick_Owens_AW19_Alex_B-667x1000.jpg) and [Dazed Magazine](https://www.tomorrowisanotherday.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Dazed_Magazine_Autum2018_byMaxvon-GumppenbergandPatrickBienert_stylingEllieGraceCumming_Alex_B-9-1498x1000.jpg).
